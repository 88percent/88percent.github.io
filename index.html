				<h3>Authors such as Arthur Miller, Henry David Thoureau, and Edgar Allan Poe have examined their society and found human nature to be such that empathy is lost for others when power is gained for oneself.</h3>

					<h2 id="evidence">The Crucible</h2>
					<h3>In Arthur Miller's "The Crucible", the main antagonist Abigail comes to manipulate the town in her favor. Using her vindictive attitude towards the wife of her love interest, she inserts herself into a position of power to affect the fates of innocent townspeople so that she can achieve her diabolical goal. With the assistance of the girls of the town who are essentially her minions, she is able to control the courtroom and the leaders of the town without fail. Through the exhibition of her newfound iniquitous and unempathetic personality, she demonstrates how the acquisition of power distorts the morality of humans.</h3>

					<h2 id="evidence">Civil Disobedience</h2>
					<h3>"The mass of men serve the state theus, not as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies. They are the standing army, and the militia, jailers, constables, <span>posse comaitatus</span>, etc. In most cases, there is no free excersise whatever of teh judgement or of the moral sense; but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and stones; and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the purpose as well."</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>Thoreau's 'Civil Disobedience' suggests that the employees of the state (those in power), lose their humanity and empathy, because their will is no longer their own. This is a more positive spin on the issue of losing empathy when gaining power, but the end result is the same. Because the state (and it's servants) can no longer make decisions based on their moral compass, they no longer have empathy. Thus, empathy is lost when individuals gain power through entering servitude of the state.</h3>

					<h2 id="evidence">Hop Frog</h2>
					<h3>The king that presides over the land also has complete authority over Hop-Frog. The king abuses his dominion over his subjects, forcing Hop-Frog to drink wine despite his alcohol intolerance or the king's barbarous assault on Trippetta for her act of standing up for Hop-Frog. Through the king's malevolent actions towards his subjects, he creates contempt for himself from Hop-Frog and Trippetta, which leads to his subsequent immolation at the hands of his ex-minions.</h3>
